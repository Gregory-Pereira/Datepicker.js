<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![November 11th Screenshot of Progress](https://github.com/ctrachte/Datepicker.js/test11112020.png|alt=testScreenshot11-11-2020)

There are many great datepickers available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. 

Here's why:
* I hate dependencies like jQuery
* I want the code to be as lightweight and portable as possible.

Of course, no one datepicker will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more to this API in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### Dependencies

Since the goal of this project is to use only vanilla JavaScript and Moment.js, we have only one dependency:
* [Moment.js](https://www.https://momentjs.com/)
